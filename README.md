Given the complexity of this task, I will use Flutter, a UI toolkit developed by Google, to build the app. Flutter allows us to build natively compiled applications for mobile (Android and iOS), web, and desktop from a single codebase.

Here are the main classes and their purposes:

1. `main.dart`: This is the entry point of our Flutter app.
2. `store.dart`: This class will represent a thrift store.
3. `store_list.dart`: This class will represent a list of thrift stores.
4. `store_detail.dart`: This class will represent the detailed view of a thrift store.
5. `store_service.dart`: This class will handle the communication with the Google Maps API.

Let's start with the `main.dart` file:
